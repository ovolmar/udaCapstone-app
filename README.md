## Project Capstone [Cloud DevOps Engineer] 

The purpose of this project is to showcase what was learned throughout the course. This project will include a CI/CD pipeline for a microservice weather application. The [weather application](https://github.com/jkaethee/Flask-Weather-App) is a project that I found in github and decided to  containerize.
